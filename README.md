Introduction
--
This work is published on Transactions on Image Processing (TIP), 2017. 

We propose an attacking method on steganography proposed by [Wu et al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6957552/), which can not only detect the stego-images but can also extract the hidden messages.
